- 😄 Riddle:
  > It cannot be heard, it cannot be felt,
Yet in its presence, all others have knelt.
It's louder than thunder, though it makes not a sound,
A weightless force that can truly astound.
It fills every corner, though it's nothing at all,
Deafening in moments when no voices call.
- 🕵️‍♂️ What is it?
