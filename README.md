# About me 👋

**LorenzovHoorde/LorenzovHoorde** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on modelling (dis)engagement states in humamns during perceptual decision-making tasks 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to fit hidden-Markov models through IOHMM and Dynamax
- 📫 How to reach me: l.p.j.van.hoorde@umail.leidenuniv.nl

- 😄 Riddle:
  > It cannot be heard, it cannot be felt,
Yet in its presence, all others have knelt.
It's louder than thunder, though it makes not a sound,
A weightless force that can truly astound.
It fills every corner, though it's nothing at all,
Deafening in moments when no voices call.
- 🕵️‍♂️ What is it?
