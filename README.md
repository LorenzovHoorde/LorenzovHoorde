- 😄 Riddle:
> It cannot be heard, it cannot be felt,<br>
> Yet in its presence, the bravest have knelt.<br>
> It's louder than thunder, though it makes not a sound,<br>
> A weightless force that can truly astound.<br>
> It fills every corner, though it's nothing at all,<br>
> Deafening in moments when no voices call.

- 🕵️‍♂️ What is it?
